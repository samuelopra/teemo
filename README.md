# Teemo: Group Recruiting Solution Platform

> "Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success." -- Henry Ford

## Challenges:

### Employees

- Individual job seekers struggle to find work if they are missing certain skills
- Employees feel unfulfilled at work if they are placed on a team that they don’t work well with
- Inexperienced employees lack project opportunities & collaborators to grow their skills

### Employers

- Start ups that are ramping up or companies venturing into new businesses need to fill positions quickly
- Teams in an organization may not have members with complementary skill sets
- It takes time for teams in a company to work together cohesively
- Employee retention is a huge problem amongst Millennials

## Teemo Solution:

### Employees

- Individuals can join teams with synergistic skill sets and find jobs more easily
- Employees can work in a team of their choosing
- Individuals can learn from other team members with skills they want to grow and develop
- Inexperienced employees can gain access to projects to level up their skills and make themselves more attractive to employers
- Working together, each member has a valuable advantage – network effect

### Employers

- Start ups & companies can fill multiple positions and create new departments quickly
- Teams are pre-formed with members having complementary skills.
- Employers can hire teams that have previous experience working well together
- Millennial employees are more likely to stay at a company if they join with their friends
